          <p style="grid-column: 2 / 5;">In the first week, the <span class="highlight">main objective was to get to know the faculty, our co-students, and the area around IAAC.</span> <br><br> To become familiar with the faculty, Guillem talked a lot about MDEF, the FabLab here as well as FabLabs all over the world, and projects of all sorts. Also, we got an overview of all the workshop areas the IAAC has to offer: 3D printing, CNC milling, laser cutting, woodworking, electronics, and robot arms, to name a few. <br><br> We were also welcomed with a spontaneous visit by Nadya Peek, who gave a presentation about “Making machines that make,” with a strong emphasis on concepts like open-source frameworks and democratizing access to digital fabrication, to immediately inspire us with awe and creativity. <br><br> </p>

          <p style="grid-column: 7 / 9;">
            In order to achieve the second goal, we had to bring some pictures of objects, a community, a background and a “more-than-human” aspect that influenced our live in some way and tell a few stories along those pictures. <br> <br> Also we went out for some drinks.
          </p>
          <p style="grid-column: 1 / 3;">
            Then, <span class="highlight">for the last task,</span> we took a leisurely stroll around Poblenou, visiting community workshops, community gardens, and community spaces for art & culture. <br> <br> I don’t think I have ever seen so much community engagement in a single place.

            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Reflection</span><br><br>
            The first weeks at MDEF have already been a diverse, challenging, and perspective-broadening experience in many regards. <br> <br>
            First of all, I am thoroughly happy with the people at the whole IAAC faculty. When I decided to come here, I imagined IAAC to be a place where people with open minds, a vision for a better future, and great technical skill come together, and I have not been disappointed. Additionally, my classmates at MDEF are much more than I could have hoped for, and I am excited to see what projects we are going to do together.
          </p>
          <p style="grid-column: 4 / 6;">
            <br><br>The first two weeks of classes at MDEF offered very new ways of thinking about design for me. The design space method helped me visualize, organize, and interconnect different fields of interest within my practice, and I have started to enjoy it as a complementary tool that will be changed and expanded alongside to reflect my own changes and developments throughout my education. <br><br>The number of communities and projects connected to IAAC was overwhelming at first, but I am excited to see what opportunities will arise from that during the program.
          </p>
          <p style="grid-column: 6 / 8;">
            <br><br>During these first weeks, we have had many introductory classes on hardware, electronics, and coding. Since this is probably the sub-field of design where I have the most experience, these classes are not too challenging for me, but I still feel like I can learn a lot. I have done some hardware hacking in the past, but never to the extent where I had a whole disused high-tech SLA printer to disassemble and then invent an entirely different functionality for the technical components. This is an awesome opportunity, and I am grateful to be able to participate in classes like these.          </p>
